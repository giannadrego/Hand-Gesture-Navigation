# Hand Gesture Based Navigation Using Deep Learning

<p align="justify">Gesture based navigation systems have changed the way we interact with technology. These systems allow users to control devices or applications through hand gestures, which makes it useful in situations where traditional input methods such as keyboards or touchscreens are inaccessible. There are multiple applications where hand gesture based navigation systems can be used such as VR headsets, smart home devices, gaming, and healthcare.</p>
<p align="justify">The goal of the project was to develop a hand gesture-based navigation system that uses deep learning models to recognize gestures and navigate interfaces by controlling various keyboard functions using hand gestures. For example, scrolling a website, pausing a video, entering into full screen mode, etc.</p>
